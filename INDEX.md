- File paths: Use absolute paths in examples

## Usage Tips for Agents

1. **Start with the index** - Don't load all files immediately
2. **Use keyword search** - Find relevant guide by task or keyword
3. **Check related guides** - Version bumps often require multiple guides
4. **Follow section structure** - Guides use consistent organization
5. **Look for checklists** - Each guide has verification checklists
6. **Check for examples** - Guides include practical examples and patterns

## Maintenance

This index should be updated when:
- New guides are added to the repository
- Existing guides are significantly restructured
- New subdirectories are created
- Guide purposes or scopes change
