# WildFly Subsystem Schema Test Requirements

## Overview

WildFly subsystems use schema-based testing to verify that XML configuration can be correctly parsed and marshalled. Each schema version requires a corresponding test XML file that provides comprehensive coverage of all schema elements, attributes, and complex types.

## Test File Location and Naming

Test XML files are located in:
```
src/test/resources/org/wildfly/extension/{subsystem-name}/
```

Naming convention:
- `{subsystem-name}-{version}.xml` - For stable versions (e.g., `elytron-oidc-client-1.0.xml`)
- `{subsystem-name}-preview-{version}.xml` - For preview versions (e.g., `elytron-oidc-client-preview-2.0.xml`)

## Test Requirements

### 1. Complete Schema Coverage

Every test XML file MUST include:

- **All elements** defined in the corresponding XSD schema
- **All attributes** for each element (including optional ones)
- **All complex types** with representative examples
- **Multiple instances** of repeatable elements where applicable
- **Both literal and expression forms** for every attribute that supports expression substitution (see Section 1a)

**Coverage Checklist:**
- [ ] All top-level elements (e.g., `realm`, `provider`, `secure-deployment`, `secure-server`)
- [ ] All child elements within each complex type
- [ ] All optional elements (at least one instance)
- [ ] All attributes (including optional ones like `algorithm` on credentials)
- [ ] Multiple instances of elements that can appear multiple times
- [ ] Each attribute appears at least once as a plain literal value
- [ ] Each attribute appears at least once as a `${property:default}` expression
- [ ] Each root element has at least one minimal entry (name only, no optional children)

### 1a. Expression Coverage Requirements

WildFly subsystem tests verify that both literal values and expression-substituted values can be parsed and round-tripped through the management model. **For every attribute that supports expressions** (defined with `.setAllowExpression(true)` in the Java attribute builder), the test XML must include at least one literal instance and at least one `${...}` expression instance somewhere across all entries of that complex type.

**Recommended pattern**: Maintain one "full literal" entry and one "full expression" entry for each complex type, rather than spreading coverage thinly across many sparse entries. For example:
- A `google` provider entry that includes every possible provider attribute as a literal value
- A `redhat-sso-expressions` provider entry that includes every possible provider attribute as an expression

This makes it easy to verify coverage at a glance and ensures new attributes added to the schema are added to both entries.

**Resource path key attributes are exempt**: The `name` attribute on elements like `credential` and `redirect-rewrite-rule` is the WildFly management address path key, NOT a model attribute. It is registered via `PathElement.pathElement(...)`, not via `SimpleAttributeDefinitionBuilder`, and does NOT support expression substitution. These `name` keys do not need expression coverage.

**Alternative attributes**: Some attributes are defined as mutually exclusive alternatives (via `.setAlternatives(...)` in Java, e.g., `auth-server-url` and `provider-url`). Combined coverage across all entries satisfies the requirement — one entry can use `auth-server-url` and another can use `provider-url`, and each needs both a literal and expression form across those combined entries.

### 1b. Minimal Configuration Coverage

> **⚠ BLOCKED** — Implementation is pending a schema bug fix. See
> `notes/bug-xsd-all-minoccurs-empty-elements.md` for details. Do not add
> minimal entries to test XML files until the bug is resolved.

In addition to the "full literal" and "full expression" coverage patterns, each root element in the subsystem must have at least one **minimal** entry — an entry that contains ONLY the management address `name` attribute, with NO optional child elements. This verifies:

1. That every child element is truly optional and can be omitted without error
2. That the subsystem can parse and round-trip a bare-bones configuration
3. That no default marshalling logic requires child elements to be present

**Pattern**: Use a self-closing tag with just the name attribute:
```xml
<realm name="minimal-realm"/>
<provider name="minimal-provider"/>
<secure-deployment name="minimal.war"/>
<secure-server name="minimal-server"/>   <!-- versions 2.0+ only -->
```

**Propagation**: Like other coverage requirements, minimal entries must be propagated to all subsequent schema versions. If `1.0.xml` has a `<realm name="minimal-realm"/>`, all later versions must also include it.

**Naming convention**: Use `minimal-` as a prefix (e.g., `minimal-realm`, `minimal-provider`) and `minimal.war` for deployments/servers to make their purpose immediately clear.

**Known blocker**: The XSD schemas define `realm-type`, `provider-type`, and `secure-deployment-type` using `<xs:all>` without `minOccurs="0"` on the group itself. Xerces (the XML validator used by the test framework) rejects empty elements for these types even though every individual child element has `minOccurs="0"`. The fix is to add `minOccurs="0"` to the `<xs:all>` opening tag in each affected complex type across all five XSD schema files. Until that schema fix is applied, minimal entries fail `testSchema` with `cvc-complex-type.2.4.b`.

### 2. Element Ordering Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Element ordering in test XML files MUST match the marshaller's output order, NOT the XSD schema order.

The XSD schema uses `<xs:all>` which allows elements in any order during parsing, but the marshaller outputs elements in a specific order determined by the subsystem's write logic.

**How to Determine Correct Ordering:**

1. Run the test with your initial XML file
2. If the test fails with a comparison error, examine the test output in:
   ```
   target/surefire-reports/{SubsystemName}SubsystemTestCase.txt
   ```
3. The "expected" section shows the marshaller's actual output order
4. Reorder elements in your test XML to match the marshaller's order
5. Re-run tests to verify

**Common Ordering Patterns:**

For the elytron-oidc-client subsystem (as an example):
- Basic configuration elements come first (e.g., `realm-public-key`, `auth-server-url`)
- Security/SSL elements follow (e.g., `ssl-required`, `truststore`)
- CORS elements are grouped together
- Timeout/connection elements are grouped
- New feature elements often come after core elements
- Request object elements follow authentication format elements

### 3. Cumulative Schema Evolution

Schema versions are cumulative - each new version builds upon the previous one:

- **Version 1.0**: Base elements
- **Version 2.0**: Base + new elements from 2.0
- **Preview 2.0**: Base + 2.0 + preview-specific elements (e.g., `scope`)
- **Preview 3.0**: Base + 2.0 + preview-2.0 + preview-3.0 elements (e.g., request object support)
- **Preview 4.0**: Base + 2.0 + preview-2.0 + preview-3.0 + preview-4.0 elements (e.g., OIDC logout)

**Best Practice**: When creating a new version's test file, start by copying the previous version's test file, update the namespace, then add only the new elements introduced in that version.

**Coverage propagation is mandatory**: When a coverage gap is discovered and fixed in an earlier version's test file (e.g., adding a missing literal to `1.0.xml`), that fix MUST be propagated to ALL subsequent versions. Each file should be logically identical to its predecessor except for:
1. The namespace URI (e.g., `urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0` → `urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:2.0`)
2. New attributes/elements added by that schema version (added to the "full literal" and "full expression" entries)

Failing to cascade coverage fixes forward means later versions will silently have the same gap.

### 4. Test Values

Use realistic but clearly test-oriented values:

- **Keys/Certificates**: Use valid-format but obviously test keys
- **URLs**: Use localhost or example.com domains
- **Ports**: Use standard ports (8080, 8180, etc.)
- **Credentials**: Use UUIDs or clearly fake values
- **Timeouts**: Use reasonable values (not extreme)

### 5. Multiple Instances

Include multiple instances of repeatable elements to verify:
- Different configuration patterns
- Different credential types (e.g., `secret`, `jwt`, `secret-jwt`)
- Different deployment scenarios (e.g., with realm, with provider, bearer-only)

## Verification Process

### Running Tests

```bash
cd wildfly/elytron-oidc-client
mvn clean test -Dtest=ElytronOidcClientSubsystemTestCase
```

### Test Failure Analysis

When a test fails:

1. **Check the error type**:
   - `ComparisonFailure`: Element ordering issue or missing/extra elements
   - `ParseException`: Invalid XML or schema violation
   - Other errors: Logic or configuration issues

2. **For ComparisonFailure**:
   - Open `target/surefire-reports/ElytronOidcClientSubsystemTestCase.txt`
   - Compare "expected" (marshaller output) vs "actual" (your XML)
   - Look for differences in element order or content
   - Update your XML to match the expected output

3. **For ParseException**:
   - Verify XML is well-formed
   - Check element names match schema exactly
   - Verify required attributes are present
   - Ensure values match expected types (boolean, integer, string, etc.)

## Review Checklist for AI Agents

When reviewing or creating subsystem test files:

- [ ] Test file exists for each schema version
- [ ] Namespace in test XML matches schema version
- [ ] All schema elements are represented at least once as a literal value
- [ ] All schema elements are represented at least once as an expression (`${...}` form)
- [ ] All attributes (including optional) are included in both literal and expression form
- [ ] Element ordering matches marshaller output (verify by running tests)
- [ ] Multiple instances of repeatable elements are included
- [ ] Test values are realistic but clearly for testing
- [ ] New version test files build upon previous versions
- [ ] Coverage fixes in any version have been propagated to all later versions
- [ ] Each root element has at least one minimal entry with no optional children
- [ ] Tests pass without comparison failures

**Coverage verification strategy**: The most reliable way to verify expression coverage is to identify the "full literal" entry for each complex type and check it contains every attribute, then do the same for the "full expression" entry. Cross-file agent verification is prone to false positives — always confirm reported gaps by directly reading the XML before making changes.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ordering Assumption**: Don't assume XSD order = marshaller order
2. **Missing Optional Elements**: Include optional elements to ensure they can be parsed
3. **Incomplete Coverage**: Missing even one element can leave gaps in validation
4. **Copy-Paste Errors**: When copying from previous versions, update all version-specific references
5. **Namespace Mismatches**: Ensure namespace exactly matches the schema version
6. **Expression Coverage Gaps**: Forgetting that each attribute needs BOTH a literal and expression form, not just one
7. **Not Cascading Fixes**: Fixing a gap in one version but forgetting to apply the same fix to all later versions
8. **Confusing Path Keys with Model Attributes**: The `name` attribute on credentials and redirect-rewrite-rules is a management resource address key — it doesn't support expressions and doesn't need expression coverage
9. **Agent False Positives in Coverage Checks**: Automated agents scanning XML for coverage can miss entries that exist in different parts of the file. Always verify a reported gap by manually reading the XML before acting on it. Confirmed gaps will also exist identically in all versions derived from the one with the gap.
10. **Missing Minimal Configuration**: Only testing full configurations and forgetting to verify that entries with only the required name attribute (and no optional children) can be parsed and marshalled

## Example: Adding a New Element

When a new element is added to a schema:

1. Identify which complex type(s) it belongs to
2. Add the element to ALL test files for versions that include it
3. Place it in the correct position (run tests to verify)
4. Use a representative test value
5. Run tests and adjust ordering if needed
6. Verify all tests pass

## Stability-Level-Specific Testing (OidcTestCase Pattern)

Some subsystems use a separate test class (e.g., `OidcTestCase`) that validates runtime behavior by parsing configurations and checking loaded values. When a subsystem supports multiple stability levels (DEFAULT, COMMUNITY, PREVIEW), this test should be parameterized to test each CURRENT stability level independently.

### Implementation Pattern

Use JUnit parameterized tests to run the same test suite against each stability level:

```java
@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class OidcTestCase extends AbstractSubsystemSchemaTest<ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema> {

    @Parameters(name = "{0}")
    public static Collection<ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema> parameters() {
        return ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema.CURRENT.values();
    }

    public OidcTestCase(ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema schema) {
        super(ElytronOidcExtension.SUBSYSTEM_NAME, new ElytronOidcExtension(),
              schema, ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema.CURRENT.get(schema.getStability()));
    }

    @Override
    protected String getSubsystemXml() throws IOException {
        return readResource(String.format("oidc-%s.xml",
            this.getSubsystemSchema().getStability().toString().toLowerCase()));
    }
}
```

### Test XML Files for Each Stability Level

Create separate test XML files for each stability level:

- `oidc-default.xml` - Uses DEFAULT stability namespace (e.g., `urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:2.0`)
- `oidc-community.xml` - Uses COMMUNITY stability namespace (e.g., `urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:community:2.0`)
- `oidc-preview.xml` - Uses PREVIEW stability namespace (e.g., `urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:preview:4.0`)

**Key Requirements:**
- Each file must use the correct namespace for its stability level
- Each file must include only features available at that stability level
- Files should NOT include XML declarations (`<?xml version="1.0"?>`)
- Element ordering must match marshaller output (alphabetical for `xs:all` schemas)

### Conditional Test Execution

Use `assumeTrue()` to skip tests for features not available at certain stability levels:

```java
@Test
public void testPreviewOnlyFeature() throws Exception {
    assumeTrue("Feature X is PREVIEW-only",
        this.getSubsystemSchema().getStability() == Stability.PREVIEW);
    // Test code here
}
```

### Adding New Features

When adding a new feature to the subsystem:

1. **Determine the initial stability level** (usually PREVIEW)
2. **Add the feature to the appropriate test XML file(s)**:
   - If PREVIEW: Add to `oidc-preview.xml` only
   - If COMMUNITY: Add to `oidc-community.xml` and `oidc-preview.xml`
   - If DEFAULT: Add to all three files
3. **Add tests for the new feature** with appropriate `assumeTrue()` guards
4. **Update test XML files** to include both literal and expression forms of new attributes

### Promoting Features Between Stability Levels

When a feature is promoted from one stability level to another (e.g., PREVIEW → COMMUNITY):

1. **Update the schema** to reflect the new stability level
2. **Move feature entries between test XML files**:
   - Remove from higher stability file (e.g., `oidc-preview.xml`)
   - Add to lower stability file (e.g., `oidc-community.xml`)
   - Ensure all lower stability files also get the feature
3. **Update `assumeTrue()` conditions** in tests:
   ```java
   // Before (PREVIEW-only):
   assumeTrue("Feature X is PREVIEW-only",
       this.getSubsystemSchema().getStability() == Stability.PREVIEW);

   // After (COMMUNITY and above):
   assumeTrue("Feature X requires COMMUNITY or higher",
       this.getSubsystemSchema().getStability().ordinal() >= Stability.COMMUNITY.ordinal());
   ```
4. **Verify all tests pass** for all stability levels

### Test Execution Results

When tests run correctly:
- Total tests = (number of test methods) × (number of stability levels)
- Skipped tests = (stability-restricted tests) × (number of stability levels where feature is unavailable)
- Example: 30 test methods × 2 stability levels = 60 total tests
  - If 6 tests are PREVIEW-only: 6 × 1 (DEFAULT run) = 6 skipped tests
  - Result: 60 tests run, 54 passed, 6 skipped

### Common Issues

1. **XML Declaration in Test Files**: Test XML files should NOT include `<?xml version="1.0"?>` declarations. The test framework reads them as strings and the declaration causes parsing errors.

2. **Element Ordering**: Marshalled XML outputs elements in a specific order (often alphabetical for `xs:all` schemas). Test XML files must match this order exactly.

3. **Namespace Mismatches**: Each test XML must use the correct namespace for its stability level. Check `ElytronOidcSubsystemSchema` enum for the correct namespace URNs.

4. **Missing Feature Removal**: When promoting a feature, don't forget to remove it from the higher stability test XML file. Leaving it in both files can cause confusion.

5. **Incorrect assumeTrue() Logic**: When promoting features, update the stability check to use ordinal comparison (`>=`) rather than equality (`==`) if the feature should be available at multiple levels.
